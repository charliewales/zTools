# list of things to work on here. . .

"""
add header to all scripts

zbw_rig:
    refactor all scripts to use groupFreeze, clean up bounding box ctls (moved in space), doc all properly
    isType is weird (transform type)
    add random selectors

extrusion rig:
    add up-vectors based on rot to ctrls to help flipping
    capp selection, keep orig, move addAttrs for offsets and repeatU to main ctrl creation, ctrls to curve
group freeze:
    add group under obj's parent 

random attr: 
    checkbox to unify all scale randomizers, on/off seems broken

wire deformer:
    add to rig tools?
